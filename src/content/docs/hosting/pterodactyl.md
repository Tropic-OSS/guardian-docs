Luckily for [Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) users I created an egg that allows you to install and run the bot with ease.

## Egg File

<a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiteCodeLabs/guardian/master/ptero-egg.json">ptero-egg.json</a>

Additionally you are able to automatically pull the latest commit to master by using this egg.

## Installing The Egg

1. Access the admin section of your panel and navigate to the Nests section.
2. Click on the green "Import Egg" button.
3. Locate the JSON file that you saved previously and select it.
4. Choose the nest where you would like to add the egg.

The egg was created following [this initial commit](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/generic/nodejs) from [parkervcp](https://github.com/parkervcp) a member on the Pterodactyl team. Go give them some love.
